## Prevent Commits to Master

Create a file, .git/hooks/pre-commit, with the following content:

#!/bin/bash

branch="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"

if [ "$branch" = "master" ] || [ "$branch" = "main" ]; then
    echo "You can't commit directly to $branch branch"
    exit 1
fi

chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
